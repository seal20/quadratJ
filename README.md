quadratJ
========

A set of macros for ImageJ and objectJ to analyze quadrats in ecology.

For the moment it is only for temperate corals and algae (what I am working on) and use the random points methods.
It is heavily inspired by CPCe (http://www.nova.edu/ocean/cpce/) but because this one is not free (libre) software and runs only under windows, I decided to start using imageJ (http://imagej.nih.gov/). The cell counter in imageJ was not enough and I used and modify the cell counter of the plugin objectJ (http://simon.bio.uva.nl/objectj/) to fit my needs.

To use it download the project file and open it with imageJ, I tested it with imageJ 1.48t and objectJ 1.03m

ToDo
====
*Write the documentation
*Add the possibility to remove all markers elsewhere than in the objectj menu
*Add the possibilty to edit the object which will automatically edit the shorcut.
*Add the tracing area methods.
*One day perhaps...completely fork objectj and create an independant plugin, if it seems good.
